  # Latest data
  # Get OHLCV latest timeseries data returned in time descending order. Data can be requested by the period and for the specific symbol eg &#x60;BITSTAMP_SPOT_BTC_USD&#x60;, if you need to query timeseries by asset pairs eg. &#x60;BTC/USD&#x60;, then please reffer to the Exchange Rates Timeseries data              :::info OHLCV Latest endpoint is just the shortcut to the OHLCV Historical endpoint with substituted &#x60;time_start&#x60; and &#x60;time_end&#x60; parameters.  The OHLCV Historical endpoint data can be delayed a few seconds. Use OHLCV real-time data stream to get data without delay. :::
