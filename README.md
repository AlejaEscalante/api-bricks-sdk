## OpenAPI Specifications

OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification files, typically named `openapi.yaml` or `openapi.json`, are provided for many of the RESTful APIs in this repository. These files define the API's structure and can be used with various tools for documentation generation, client SDK creation, and testing.

You can generally find these specification files within the respective API's directory. Common locations include:
* A `spec/` subdirectory directly within the API's folder (e.g., `coinapi/market-data-api-rest/spec/openapi.yaml`).
* Within language-specific SDK directories, often under an `api/` or similar subdirectory (e.g., `finfeedapi/sec-api-rest/sdk/java/api/openapi.yaml`).

Please explore the individual API directories for the most up-to-date and specific locations of these files.
