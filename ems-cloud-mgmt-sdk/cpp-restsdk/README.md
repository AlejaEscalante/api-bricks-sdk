# C++ API client

This section will provide necessary information about the `CoinAPI EMS Managed Cloud REST API` protocol. 
<br/><br/>
This API is used to manage the overall deployment of **Execution Management System API** (`EMS API`) software, 
which means that in this API, you define the accounts, credentials, and configurations for the order destinations or identify the CoinAPI endpoints where you need to connect to access the `EMS API`. 
<br/><br/>
Implemented Standards:

 * [HTTP1.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945)
 * [HTTP1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)
 * [HTTP2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540)

### Authentication

To use resources that require authorized access, you will need to provide an API key to us when making HTTP requests.

There are 2 methods for passing the API key to us, you only need to use one:

 1. Custom authorization header named `X-CoinAPI-Key`
 2. Query string parameter named `apikey`

#### Custom authorization header

You can authorize by providing additional custom header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` and API key as its value.

Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like:
<br/><br/>
`X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`

<aside class=\"success\">This method is recommended by us and you should use it in production environments.</aside>

#### Query string authorization parameter

You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named `apikey` with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.

Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY` and that you want to request all accounts, then your query string should look like this: 
<br/><br/>
`GET /v1/accounts?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`

<aside class=\"notice\">
Query string method may be more practical for development activities.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Install [cpprestsdk](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk).

- Windows: `vcpkg install cpprestsdk cpprestsdk:x64-windows boost-uuid boost-uuid:x64-windows`
- Mac: `brew install cpprestsdk`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install libcpprest-dev`

### Build

```sh
cmake -DCPPREST_ROOT=/usr -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
make
```

### Build on Windows with Visual Studio (VS2017)

- Right click on folder containing source code
- Select 'Open in visual studio'
- Once visual studio opens, CMake should show up in top menu bar.
- Select CMake > Build All.

*Note: If the CMake menu item doesn't show up in Visual Studio, CMake
for Visual Studio must be installed. In this case, open the 'Visual Studio
Installer' application. Select 'modify' Visual Studio 2017. Make sure
'Desktop Development with C++' is installed, and specifically that 'Visual
C++ tools for CMake' is selected in the 'Installation Details' section.

Also be sure to review the CMakeLists.txt file. Edits are likely required.*
